      ## 📊 How to display hourly data in Energy dashboard?
      Use "tauron_importer" statistics instead of entities to show hourly data in the Energy dashboard.

      ---

      ## ⚠️ Why are there missing days in statistics/Energy dashboard?
      Gaps appear when there are missing values in hourly readings for a given day. Confirm on the eLicznik website for that date.

      ---

      ## 🔧 How to fix missing data in statistics/Energy dashboard?
      Once the data appears on eLicznik, you can fill gaps using the `tauron_amiplus.download_statistics` service.

      ---

      ## ⏱️ When does this integration update data?
      The integration logs in and downloads data from eLicznik approximately every 8.5 hours. This timer restarts after HA restart, integration reload, or configuration change. A fresh download also occurs when diagnostics are retrieved.

      ---

      ## 🔢 How to get energy meter id?
      Follow the integration documentation to find the `energy_meter_id` value (from your eLicznik/Tauron account details).

      ---

      ## ⚡ How to calculate available energy as a prosumer?
      Add the following configuration. Replace `123` with your meter id and adjust `0.8` factor and initial bank as needed.

      ```yaml
      input_number:
        initial_energy_bank:
          min: 0
          max: 100000000
          step: 1
          mode: box

      template:
        - sensor:
            - name: Tauron energy bank
              state_class: total
              device_class: energy
              unique_id: tauron_energy_bank
              icon: mdi:home-battery-outline
              state: "{{ (states('input_number.initial_energy_bank') | float(0) + states('sensor.tauron_amiplus_123_yearly_energy_generation') | float(0) * 0.8 - states('sensor.tauron_amiplus_123_yearly_energy_consumption') | float(0)) | round(3) }}"
              unit_of_measurement: "kWh"
              availability: "{{ states('sensor.tauron_amiplus_123_yearly_energy_generation') | is_number and states('sensor.tauron_amiplus_123_yearly_energy_consumption') | is_number }}"
      ```

      Add this to your configuration (e.g., in a package or `configuration.yaml`).
