# Modern Dashboard Example
# Demonstrates various card types and layouts using available sensors
#
# This package configures a YAML-mode dashboard showcasing:
# - Multiple themed views (Overview, Lights, Climate, System, Media, Settings)
# - Modern card types (entity, button, gauge, sensor graphs, etc.)
# - Grid layouts and responsive design
# - Using actual devices from inventory
# - Battery monitoring, system updates, automation controls
#
# IMPORTANT: This creates a YAML-mode dashboard. You can either:
# 1. Use this as your main dashboard (replaces UI mode)
# 2. Keep it as a separate dashboard in the sidebar
# 3. Copy sections into your existing UI-configured dashboard
#
# To disable this and use UI mode instead, comment out this entire file.
